A tool to check the status of a weblink and also see whether it is archived
in the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). 

Try it out here [httpreserve.info](http://httpreserve.info)

## Default Server

The library comes with a default server mode that can be configured for
POST and GET requests. POST by default. Default port is :2040 but this can
also be selected at runtime.

The default server can also be stood up as a web service. The API is
documented below. 

## Client

The httpreserve client is a separate application offering a broader range of
access methods. See: https://github.com/httpreserve/httpreserve-app

The client application is a work in progress. Stay tuned for more
information about its capabilities. 

## API

**GET** example:

* Return JSON struct with information about the service you requested:

    [http://<i>{httpreserve-ip-address}:{port}</i>/httpreserve?url=http://www.google.com&filename=filename.txt](http://httpreserve.info/httpreserve?url=http://www.google.com&filename=filename.txt)

* Manage a save request to the internet archive and return HTTPreserve struct:

    [http://<i>{httpreserve-ip-address}:{port}</i>/save?url=http://www.google.com&filename=filename.txt](http://httpreserve.info/httpreserve?url=http://www.google.com&filename=filename.txt)
